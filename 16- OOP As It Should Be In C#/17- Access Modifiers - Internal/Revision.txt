internal access modifier

When we declare a type or type member as internal, it can be accessed only within the same assembly (Same DLL).

An assembly is a collection of types (classes, interfaces, etc) and resources (data). They are built to work together and form a logical unit of functionality.

That's why when we run an assembly all classes and interfaces inside the assembly run together.

Note: Internal in C# is equivalent to friend in C++.
